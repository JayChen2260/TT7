## How it works

So this clock is configured off of the FPGA clock at 20 MhZ. However, the clock is configurable to different frequencies and settings.

## How to test

See if the clock works. The first, second, and third switches should speed up/slow down the clock, which can be used to set the clock. The fourth switch is used to go to arduino mode. The fifth, sixth switches should allow you to switch between the minutes display and the hours display respectively. The seventh switch should allow you you to run the clock in 4 segment display mode. 

## External hardware

PMOD 2 segment display, possible 4 segment
